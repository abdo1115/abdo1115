# Welcome 👋


I primarily code in **C/++/html/css/js** as a hobby and officially work as a **full-stack developer**.
However, I'm mostly known for messing with Windows on an unusally sophisticated low level. 🛠

* 📚 Maths/CompSci lecturer *(incidentally, a CompSci student)*
* 🐱‍💻 Middle low-level developer
* 🗜 Junior full-stack engineer
* 📸 Hobbyist semi-popular YouTuber
* 💾 Malware perservationist/historian
* 🦟 Current owner of YouAreAnIdiot and HURR-DURR JavaScript trojans
* ♟ GM Candidate

I also enjoy plenty of other activities, and sometimes I wish there were 48 hours in a day.  
*Life's short and I try to make it enjoyable for myself and other nice people around me.*
